# cmake-example
A project demonstrating the use of [cmake](https://cmake.org/) for C projects

This project is a part of a multi-part series of projects which show you the basics of automatic dependency generation for C projects.  See  also:
 * GNU Make automatic dependency generation: https://github.com/cu-ecen-5013/auto-dependency-generation-example
 * Autoconf/Automake : https://github.com/cu-ecen-5013/autoconf-automake-example

## Testing
Run `make test` to invoke the [test.sh](test.sh) script.  This script touches header and source files and checks make output to ensure exactly expected build steps are being invoked.
